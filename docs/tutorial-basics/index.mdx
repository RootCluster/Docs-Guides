The basic Docusaurus uses relevant examples. The sidebar directory of this chapter does not use `_category_.json` to configure, but uses a separate `.mdx` file, where you can use the support `markdown` writing like a normal article.

There are five chapters in this section, starting from [Related Configurations](docusaurus-conf.md), To create the '3' types ([Pages](create-a-page.md), [Docs](create-a-document.md), [blog](create-a-blog-post.md)) of the article format, And examples of the common [' markdown 'feature](markdown-features/markdown-features.mdx)
